
### What’s wrong?
- The merge conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) should not be in the final file.
- There are two conflicting code blocks: one with var myVar = "Hello, world!"; and another with console.log("Hello, world!");.
- There is an incomplete checklist item: - [ ] (without any text after it).
- The heading # is empty.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
